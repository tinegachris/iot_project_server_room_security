Testing
Server tests (tests/test_main.py, tests/test_routes.py) and integration tests (tests/integration/):
– Create or update tests to verify the new API endpoints and ensure the end-to-end flow works as expected.
– Write unit tests for any new sensor handling or business logic added in the controllers.
