# Setup and Deployment Instructions for the Raspberry Pi

...existing content...

The error you're encountering while attempting to install the picamera library on your Windows system arises because picamera is specifically designed for Raspberry Pi devices running a Linux-based operating system. During installation, it tries to access /proc/cpuinfo, a file present in Linux systems that provides CPU information, but absent in Windows environments. This discrepancy leads to the FileNotFoundError you've observed.

If your goal is to develop or test code that will eventually run on a Raspberry Pi, you might want to install picamera on your Windows system to enable code completion and linting in your development environment. While the library won't functionally operate on Windows, installing it can help maintain a smoother development workflow. To achieve this, you can set the READTHEDOCS environment variable to True before installation, which bypasses certain checks during the setup process:

For Windows PowerShell:

powershell

$env:READTHEDOCS="True"
pip install picamera
