camera.py

This module handles video surveillance functions using the Raspberry Pi Camera.
It uses the picamera library to record video clips when triggeredâ€”typically upon an intrusion event.
The recording function allows for customization of camera settings to suit surveillance needs.

Functions:
    record_video(duration, resolution, framerate, rotation, brightness):
        Records a video for the specified duration with optional camera settings.
